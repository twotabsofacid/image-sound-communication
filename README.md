# Image Sound Interpretation

> Playing around with some image to sound back to image translation

### Getting Started

Install dependencies with `yarn install`, then run the backend with

```
yarn server
```

and start electron with

```
yarn electron
```

I'm in the process of figuring out why `pm2` isnt working for this, so just hold on with that.
